\\ ASSIGNMENT																 \\
\\***************************************************************************\\
Rewrite all the algorithms seen in class in C++, java, C#, D, Go, Javascript, 
Scala, Haskell, Erlang, or Clojure, including tests (not including functions 
that require data downloading, assume loading data from CSV file). The 
algorithms should include proper documentation strings explaining the purpose 
of the algorithm, the input and the output, and possible exceptions. It is not 
necessary to explain how the algorithm works. (30 points)

You MUST use a version control system like GIT or Mercurial and make your code 
publicly available. Your code MUST be released under the BSD license. I will 
check your commit history.

By February 6, 2012 you must have chosen the language and provide a working 
implementation of the Linear Algebra algorithms and a link to the code 
repository (I recommend GitHub). (10 points)

For the final project you can work in groups of 2 or 3 students but you have 
to finalize your groups by February 6 and must include a report about the roles
of each member of the group.

Ruthann will be working on this project by herself, taking on all roles of 
planning and development. She will be using Java to implement the algorithms
of CSC 431.
