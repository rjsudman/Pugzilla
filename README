Inverse matrix currently has a bug and should read: 
[[1,2,3],[1,0,3],[2,2,4]]
[[-1.5,-0.5,1.5],[0.5,-0.5,0],[0.5,0.5,-0.5]]
[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]] 
and not 
[ {1.0, 2.0, 3.0} {1.0, 0.0, 3.0} {2.0, 2.0, 4.0} ]
[ {0.0, 0.0, 0.0} {NaN, NaN, NaN} {NaN, NaN, NaN} ]
[ {NaN, NaN, NaN} {NaN, NaN, NaN} {NaN, NaN, NaN} ]
